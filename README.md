# XRF Books

XRF Books is a library cataloguing module for XRF. It's designed to handle multiple types of media such as books, e-books, movies, music, and video games.

Note that the primary focus is now [XRF Books for Sandstorm](https://github.com/ocdtrekkie/xrf_books_sandstorm), and while I may port some compatible adjustments back to this version, it is deprecated at this point.
